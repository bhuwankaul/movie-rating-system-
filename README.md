# movie-rating-system-
movie revenue and rating system which uses data from excel sheet and the queries are processed through mysql and finally the representation in Tableau.

First You need to download the excel sheet & CSV sheet 
after that go to MYSQL workbench and create a new database 
in that data base create a table by writing the query

create table MOVIE_DATA(
S_NO INT,
MOVIE_NAME VARCHAR(30),
NO_OF_MOVIES INT,
BUDGET DECIMAL,
BOX_OFFICE DECIMAL,
RATING DECIMAL);

Run and execute the query and a new table will be created, After that import the csv file into the table.

Now open the Sql queries into the workbench and run save the output as CSV file into the pc, Don't worry if you don;t
know how to do that. I have already put the csv queries output in the files section.

Now open tableau and open all the CSV output files and use your skills to demonstrate the outputs as you wish.
I have attached the Screenshot for your reference.

Thank you. :)
